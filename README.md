# (Not the) Microchip PolarFire SoC Linux Software Development Kit

Started as a fork of the SDK repo to test some readme content, is now a dumping
ground for my random scripts/configs etc for kernel work.

Don't use it if you expect anything other than hacking at it so that it builds
outside of my machines.
